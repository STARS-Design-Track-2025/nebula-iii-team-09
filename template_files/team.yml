# Feel free to change these two values if you want to use

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT manually edit the (external_interface) LA or WB Master signals. 
# Use the project_info keys above.
# You can check out what those keys do in /scripts/team_configuration.py, but basically they will 
# adjust this file and the wrapper file to cleanly enable and disable the WB / LA signals.
# To add registers check out "registers" and "flags" and "ports" below
